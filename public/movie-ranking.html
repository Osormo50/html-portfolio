<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>The story development was flawless—every moment was engaging, making the three-hour runtime fly by.<br>

<h3>Superbad</h3>
<p>This movie was the one that truly got me into comedy—Seth Rogen and his crew never disappoint!</p>

<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p>A controversial one, but the moment I saw the Seth Rogen and James Franco combo, I knew I was going to love it!</p>
